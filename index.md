# For the boys
This website is built on the theme "just-the-docs" which you can see the details of here: 

[just-the-docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/){: .btn .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 }

It seems like a really good layout for a wiki, easy to add content via markdown and has integration as well. If you're more curious you can see the details on their website.

We can host this ourselves via github pages and can do all the control ourselves. Keep in mind for github pages, all the site files are public.
