# Machine Lubrication
{: .no_toc }

The HS3 requires routine lubrication of the motion system to maintain exceptional performance.

Over lubrication can cause increased wear and component failure. Do not add more than the recommended quantities of grease to the bearings and ball screws.

The machine’s motion system should be lubricated annually with a high-speed, low particle emitting grease. Visit Pantheon Design to purchase grease in pre-filled syringes.

The Z axis linear bearings and ball screw support bearings are lubricated for life.

An extra-long blunt-tipped 14 Gauge needle is required to lubricate the linear bearings.

## Lubrication Amount

Grease is supplied in 1ml syringes, approximately 4 of which are required to complete a lubrication.

Be mindful of the scale on the syringe. Each tick represents 0.1ml, see the image below:

The relubrication quantities for each motion component are as follows:

| Motion Component | Grease Amount |
| X and Y Axis linear bearings | 0.2ml |
| X, Y and Z Axis Ballscrews | 0.6ml |


## Lubrication Locations

Inject lubricant into the linear component’s lubrication ports using a 1ml syringe. Ensure that lubricant does not backflow around the syringe at the port, but rather is pushed into the linear component.
