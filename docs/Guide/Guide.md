# Guide
{: .no_toc }

This is where we can put all the information a user would need to run their machine effectively.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Would probably just rely on the table of contents to funnel people to the intended section

Likely wouldn't have much on this page exactly, just an overview perhaps and then the table of contents as a navigation structure.

blue
{: .label .label-blue }
what if there is text here?
green
{: .label .label-green }

and how about here?
purple
{: .label .label-purple }

yellow
{: .label .label-yellow }

and the last test is here.

red
{: .label .label-red }
