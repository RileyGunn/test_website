Probably dont really need a table of contents on the FAQ.

Would rather have a list or table with all the FAQs and quick answers shown plus links to more detailed answers.


| Question         | Answer                   | Link to more Details |
|:-------------    |:------------------       |:------|
| Which printer is the worst?               | Not our machines      | [Printer Parts]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/Guide/Maintenance/Parts List.md %}) |
| Waht happens when you put a really long quesiton such as this one and and really long answer as shown in the next box together in the markdown text editor? Does it break the table or can you just type all willy-nilly?     | It seems the table will scale to however large the question and answer are which is great. It does kind of show how poorly the format of the website is since it appears pretty thin. Doesn't extend to the edges of the page. But it should still do the trick. A lot of wasted space though. It will make the webpages tall rather than using the available space.         | Link to section  |
